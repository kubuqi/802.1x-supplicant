<title>Supported Platforms</title>

<para>Xsupplicant is designed to work with Linux.  Early versions of 
xsupplicant also supported *BSD and Mac OS X, but this support was pulled 
out for various reasons.  Mac OS X support was pulled because Apple 
is now providing a built-in supplicant as of Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther).  
*BSD support was initially removed largely due to a lack of active 
*BSD development.  Some *BSD code does remain, however, and we encourage 
any *BSD developers out there to test xsupplicant and submit patches or 
file bug reports to improve *BSD support.  There has been talk of adding 
Mac OS X support back into xsupplicant, because Apple's client only works 
with their own Airport cards.  Xsupplicant could potentially fill the gap 
left by Apple for those users that wish to use 3rd party cards, or 
wireless standards not supported by Apple, such as 802.11a, but such 
support would require 3rd party APIs to properly handle Dynamic WEP.

Xsupplicant releases are typically tested and developed on Slackware Linux 
(AND OTHERS?).  What about adding a table of tested radius servers and 
which EAP types we have tested against on those servers?</para>

<para>insert table showing a variety of platforms and 1x projects and where
each one works.  (platforms = linux, mac os x, mac 9, windows flavors, 
freebsd, openbsd, others?)  (projects = open1x, meetinghouse, funk, 
Alfa+Ariss, wEAP, native on some platforms, others?)</para>
