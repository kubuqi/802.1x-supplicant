<section>
<title>Do I Need Open1x?</title>
<para>The short answer is that if you need to authenticate to an 802.1x-enabled
network using Linux, then Open1x is probably for you.  The Open1x project 
provides 802.1x functionality for the Linux operating system.  802.1x is an 
IEEE standard (ratified in 2001) that provides port-based authentication 
at layer 2 of the OSI model.  802.1x prevents unauthorized network access
until appropriate credentials are supplied to access the network.  
The Open1x project provides the necessary software to connect to an 
802.1x-enabled network.</para>

<title>Xsupplicant versus Authenticator</title>
<para>The Open1x project contains source code for both the "Supplicant" 
and "Authenticator" pieces of the 802.1x standard.  This document will 
only focus on the Open1x Supplicant (xsupplicant), as the Authenticator 
isn't being actively worked on at this point in time.</para>
