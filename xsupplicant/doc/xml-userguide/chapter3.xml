<title>Pre-Packaged Releases for Some Distibutions</title>
<para>At some point we plan on releasing pre-packaged versions of xsupplicant 
for distributions such as Debian, RedHat, SuSe, Slackware, etc... 
If you would like to see your favorite distribution supported, please 
let us know (Or better yet, send us the package)!</para>

<section>
<title>CVS</title>
<para>We do not recommend CVS downloads for people unfamiliar with it. 
CVS often contains new features that have not yet made it into a 
stable release, but it can also be extremely unstable.  We also do not 
have the time to explain how CVS works (there is good documentation on the web 
regarding CVS and its many features/options).  We encourage users to submit 
patches against CVS, but patches may not necessarily be commited immediately.  

To download xsupplicant via CVS 
you can use the following commands: </para>

<para>cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/open1x login
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/open1x co xsupplicant
</para>
