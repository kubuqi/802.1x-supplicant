Drivers
=======
This directory is a far from all-inclusive set of drivers that have 
one or more small fixes to allow the use of dynamic keys. The prevalant 
problem is one of dropped associations when a key is set. We make no
guarantees about the correctness of this code and we certainly don't
guarantee these to be the latest versions. Also, these files are
presented under the same licenses as their original distribution
(noted in each) and do not necessarily have the same license as our
code.


Usage
=====
For all files, you should be able to just replace the original version
with the one provided and rebuild the source. Information about how to
do these builds is not provided here.


Your Help
=========
We encourage you to take your favorite driver, test it, and let us
know the results. If it's broken and we have the ability to test it we
will do so and try to fix it. However, the best action would be to fix
it yourself and send it to us for distribution.


Other Drivers
=============
Many drivers out there will allow dynamic re-keying "as is" and do not
need changes. We will attempt to keep the following list up to date,
but again it is not comprehensive and could change rapidly.
