This is now called Post-Auth-Type, for consistency.

Post-Auth-Type is used to select between groupings of
modules in the post-auth stanza using arbitrary attributes.
It is functionally identical to Acct-Type, apart from
the name of the attribute and its dealing with rejected
requests.. This means that (unlike Autz-Type) the attribute
must be set before the stanza is run. Changes to
Post-Auth-Type during post-auth will have no effect.

If a request has been rejected, the value of Post-Auth-Type
is overwritten with REJECT automatically, so anonymous
modules like my_ippool below will not be run, only
modules like my_detail below in the appropriate substanza
will be run.

post-auth {
	my_ippool

	Post-Auth-Type REJECT {
		my_detail
	}
}
