( The FreeRADIUS web site is at <URL: http://www.freeradius.org/>, and
most information referenced in this document can be found there.

This is primarily for non-developers of the FreeRADIUS server.  If you are
able to patch the code to work correctly, then we invite you to join the 
development list to discuss it.  If you're the type who know little about
how to code, then this is the place for you!


= So you think you've found a bug in the FreeRADIUS server

You should first discuss it on the users list, to see if anyone can repro-
duce it.  Often there's a simple explanation of why the server behaves as
it does, and it's not necessarily a bug in the code, so browse the lists'
archives of the last two months, and if you don't see messages about it,
ask!

If the behavior is correct but confusing, we think that's a bug too, and
you should file a bug against our documentation.


= Looking at core dumps

If the server, or one of the accompyaning programs core dumps, then
you should rebuild the server as follows:

$ ./configure --enable-developer
$ make
$ make install

  and then run the program again.  You may have to to enable core
  dumps, via:

$ ulimit -c unlimited

  When it core dumps, do:

$ gdb /path/to/executable /path/to/core/file

  And then in 'gdb', do:

$ bt

  Copy the output, and mail it to the list, along with the name of the
program you were running, and the name of the operating system.
Without this information, it's impossible for anyone to know why the
program core dumped.
