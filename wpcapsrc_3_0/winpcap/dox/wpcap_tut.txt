/** @defgroup wpcap_tut WinPcap tutorial: a step by step guide to program WinPcap
 *  @{


This section shows how to exploit the different features of the WinPcap API. It is organized as a tutorial, subdivided in a set of lessons that will guide the reader step by step inside the art of programming WinPcap, from the simple basic functions (obtaining the adapters list, starting a capture) to the most advanced ones (handling send queues, gathering statistics about network traffic). 

Several code snippets, as well as simple but complete programs are provided as a reference: all this source code contains links to the rest of the manual, therefore it is possible to click on the functions and data structure to jump to their documentation.

The samples are written in plain C, so a basic knowledge of C programming is required. Also, since this is a tutorial on a library for raw networking, good knowledge of networks and protocols is assumed.
