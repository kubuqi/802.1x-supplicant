/** @defgroup wpcap_tut2 Obtaining advanced information about installed devices
 *  @{

Lesson 1 (\ref wpcap_tut1) showed how to get basic information (i.e. device name and description) about available adapters. Actually, WinPcap provides also other advanced information. In particular, every pcap_if structure returned by pcap_findalldevs() contains also a list of pcap_addr structures, with:
- a list of addresses for that interface.
- a list of netmasks (each of which corresponds to an entry in the addresses list).
- a list of broadcast addresses (each of which corresponds to an entry in the addresses list).
- a list of destination addresses (each of which corresponds to an entry in the addresses list).

The following sample provides an ifprint() function that prints the whole content of a pcap_if structure. It is invoked by the program for every entry returned by pcap_findalldevs().

\include iflist/iflist.c
