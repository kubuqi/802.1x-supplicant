Makefile and patches provided by Nate Lawson (nate@rootlabs.com)


Only the Packet and WPCAP DLLs can be built under gcc.  The drivers
(packet.sys and packet.vxd) are too dependent on MSVC for their tools and assembler.

To build packet.dll, cd to Packet9x/DLL/Project (or packetNtx/...) and type
"make". To build wpcap.dll, cd to WPCAP/PRJ and type "make". 
"make install" in either directory installs the DLL in c:/windows/system

If you want to link with your programs, use libpacket.a and libwpcap.a.
These are the import libraries for gcc.  You CANNOT use the MSVC-generated
.lib files with gcc.  For help on how to link to them, see the developer's
pack examples.

To remove all objects, type "make clean".

TODO:
Make VXD and SYS build on non-VC platforms - NOT TRIVIAL.  Possible routes
include:
Look into reactos.com and monitor cygwin.com/ml/cygwin for DDK equivalents.
Port *.asm to GNU as.
