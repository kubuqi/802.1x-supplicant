Protocol difference between 802.11 and 802.3
--------------------------------------------

1. The NIC forms an association with a certain AP prior to any
   communications taking place, in the process of which both learn
   about each other's MAC-adress. Instead of a 'well-known' group
   address, the actual hardware address of the AP must be used for
   802.1x communication.

2. The AP may (meaningfully) utilize EAPOL_KEY frames to supply
   WEP-encryption-keys. As this (to the best of my knowledge) not
   relevant for cable ethernet, support is unimplemented.

3. Roaming should theoretically work, as the client will detect if
   the PAE-adress changes and try to initiate a fresh authentication.

An implementation should be a subclass of ll_ether, with recv_hook
implementing an adress check and resetting of the destination hardware
adress in case that of the PAE changes. WEP dynamic rekeying support
should be added to ll_eapol as (virtual) no-op and appropriately
overridden in the descendant class of ll_802_3 * and probably a command line 
option like -11, to use either ll_802_11 oder ll_802_3 as 'real' io-object.
